# What is R Programming ?

[R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R. It was designed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is currently developed by the R Development Core Team.

## Advantages 

- Open Source
- Platform Independent
- Has lots of packages
- Great for Statistics
- Suited for [Machine Learning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning)
- Lets you perform Data Wrangling (the process of removing errors and combining complex data sets to make them more accessible and easier to analyze)

# [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/downloads/)
RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R and Python. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management. RStudio is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux).

### Simple Code

```R
  5 + 5                     // result is 10
```
